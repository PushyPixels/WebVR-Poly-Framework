# WebVR-Poly-Framework
An Oculus Quest compatible WebVR framework for creating games that supports Poly content (Tiltbrush, Google Blocks, etc)

# What it is
This project right now is basically Mozilla's [Unity WebVR Export](https://github.com/mozilla/unity-webvr-export) and Google's [Poly Tookit for Unity](https://github.com/googlevr/poly-toolkit-unity) mashed into one project.  It will have more examples and cool stuff built by me later, but for now this is basically it.

# What you need
This project is confirmed to work on **Unity version 2018.3.14f1**.  Other Unity versions may work, but I have confirmed it **DOES NOT WORK** on Unity version 2018.2.6f1 nor 2018.3.0a3

# Example
To see what this project looks like in WebVR, I'll be uploading builds to https://pushypixels.github.io/.  The project currently has performance problems on Quest that I am looking into.  Hopefully they will be resolvable.

# License
As both the Unity WebVR Export and Poly Toolkit for Unity were both under Apache 2.0 license, for simplicity I've adopted this license too.
