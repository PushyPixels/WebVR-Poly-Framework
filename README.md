# WebVR-Poly-Framework
An Oculus Quest compatible WebVR framework for creating games that supports Poly content (Tiltbrush, Google Blocks, etc)

# What it is
This project right now is basically Mozilla's [Unity WebVR Export](https://github.com/mozilla/unity-webvr-export) and Google's [Poly Tookit for Unity](https://github.com/googlevr/poly-toolkit-unity) mashed into one project.  It will have more examples and cool stuff built by me later, but for now this is basically it.

# Example
To see what this project looks like in WebVR, I'll be uploading builds to https://pushypixels.github.io/

# License
As both the Unity WebVR Export and Poly Toolkit for Unity were both under Apache 2.0 license, for simplicity I've adopted this license too.
